### Amit Levinon's website

Hey there!

Welcome to the repository of my website [www.amitlevinson.com](www.amitlevinson.com).   

The website was built with the following:  

* `R` programming language + `{blogdown}` package and [book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)  

* [`Hugo` Framework](https://gohugo.io/) + [Academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/)

**Please feel free to fork, copy and use whatever you'd like!**
