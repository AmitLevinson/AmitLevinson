## Intro

- Intro on job search process

During the first half of 2021, as I was finishing up my M.A. thesis, I started searching for a job in Data Analytics. [My journey into analytics was through learning R](https://amitlevinson.com/blog/my-year-in-r/) and I realized I had to learn some SQL, or at least familiarize myself with it. So 


  - various questions
  
  - Not representing my employer

  - Some basic knowledge of SQL (or R also if you ask me) can help

## The case

- show the case with the question

- provide the question with another one - reframed

## Solutions

### 1. Window functions

### 2. Self Join

### 3. Correlated subquery
