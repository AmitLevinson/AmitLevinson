The secrets in the Action:
[GitHub automatically creates a `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret to use in your workflow once you set up an Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow) in a repository. The token's permission are limited to the specific repository, but for our case it's adequate.

further adding of google analytics tags:

Site doesn't build from the public folder:
https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/495

If you find yourself getting weird commit requirements for stuff in the folder `resources` or `.Rporj.user` when just changing between branches then just gitignore them. This is defninitely not from professional knowledge, just my experience when searching for the issue online.

Essentially Hugo searches its [partials](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/) (page templates such as header, footer, etc) in two places:

1. `layouts/partials/*<PARTIALNAME>.html` (We'll call this 'ours')  
2. `themes/<THEME>/layouts/partials/*<PARTIALNAME>.html` (We'll call this default)

If it won't find anything in our `layouts/partials`, it'll go to its default in the themes folder. My workflow is if I edit something, e.g. a site footer, I add it to my `layouts/partials`.  
Now, if you're like me, your probably just set up Google Analytics through your `config.toml`, specifically under `GoogleAnalytics = "UA-XXXXXXXXX-X"`.

When Hugo builds the site it parses all partials, and while parsing the `site_head.html` it'll [call the Google Analytics tag](https://github.com/AmitLevinson/amitlevinson.com/blob/e229045f6f90fe6221cddc6508743cfc8e269a1a/themes/hugo-academic/layouts/partials/site_head.html#L137-L138). More specifically, it runs:

```
{{ partial "marketing/google_analytics" . }}
{{ partial "marketing/google_tag_manager" . }}
```

What we want to do is edit the Google Analytics tag so it accounts for another branch. However, since I like to move any partials I edited from the themes, so I know in the future I've already edited it in the past, we'll just cut the `marketing` folder to our `partials/layout`. Now Hugo will render it from there and we'll know where to edit when we decide to stop the test.
