<p>Israel just had its 3rd election in a row on March 2, 2020.
This is because our Knesset (Hebrew term for house of representatives) wasn’t able to form or hold a government after the previous elections. As I won’t get into the politics of why they didn’t succeed thus far (get it? politics :wink:), I do want to take the opportunity and analyze some tweets posted in the time before and after the elections.</p>
<div id="gathering-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Gathering the data <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></h3>
<p>Twitter’s API only always scraping for free 6-9 days back. therefore I scraped the data already on March 7, 2020 and saved it for later use. To gather the tweets we can use the <code>{rtweet}</code> package which is amazingly easy to use (<a href="https://rtweet.info/">Check out its website</a>).</p>
<p>Let’s start with the packages we’ll use:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(rtweet)
library(hrbrthemes)</code></pre>
<p>Next we’ll gather the tweets we need:</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier I already scraped the data to save it but wrote it here in case you’re wondering how we gather them. I used only one term, which in hebrew is “elections”, and gathered all tweets using that word.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I will say this post doesn’t aim to be representative of the discussions that were held during the election period. As a matter of fact, nor does it aim to be representative of the twitter discussion. this is due for several reasons:<br />
1. Twitter isn’t common in Israel at all. I’m not sure what’s the usage rate but it’s definitely not representative of the Israel population.<br />
2. I searched for only one word - elections (in Hebrew) - which yielded some 16,000 tweets. This is definitely not a large enough dataset for a representation.</p>
<p>With that said, the data gathered provides an opportunity to look at some Twitter data from the elections period.</p>

<div id="lets-begin" class="section level3">
<h3>Let’s begin</h3>
<p>First, let’s see how the tweets distribute across the time span we searched for. we can create a quick time plot using the <code>ts_plot()</code> from the <code>{rtweet}</code> package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>elections %&gt;% 
  ts_plot(&quot;2 hours&quot;)+
  theme_ipsum_rc()+
  scale_x_datetime(date_breaks = &quot;1 day&quot;,date_labels = &quot;%d %b&quot;)+
    labs(x= NULL, y = NULL,
       title = &quot;Frequency of tweets throughout the Israeli elections&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;Tweets are counts aggregated using a two-hour interval.\nonly tweets with the word &#39;elections&#39; (in Hebrew) were gathered&quot;)+
  geom_text(aes(x = as.POSIXct(&quot;2020-03-02 22:10:00&quot;), y = 425, label = &quot;10 PM:\nClosing of\npolls&quot;),
            hjust = 0, size = 3, family=&quot;Courier New&quot;)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.POSIXct(&quot;2020-03-02 22:00&quot;),linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;, size = 1)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/elections-twitter/2020-03-09-israeli-elections-on-twitter_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Intersting, we see the number of tweets during the closing time is equivalent to that of XXXX.</p>
</div>
<div id="users-with-most-tweets" class="section level3">
<h3>USers with most tweets</h3>
<p>Next, let’s look at who tweeted the most:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>elections %&gt;% 
  count(screen_name, sort = T) %&gt;% 
  slice(1:15) %&gt;% 
  mutate(screen_name = reorder(screen_name,n)) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x= screen_name, y= n))+
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,180, 20), labels = seq(0,180,20))+
  labs(x = &quot;Screen name&quot;, y = &quot;Number of tweets&quot;, title = &quot;Top 15 users tweeting the word &#39;elections&#39; (בחירות)\nduring the 3rd Israeli elections&quot;)+
  theme_ipsum_rc()+
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())</code></pre>
