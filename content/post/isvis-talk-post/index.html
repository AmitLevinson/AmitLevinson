<p><br></p>
<p>A few weeks ago, on May 12, 2022, I gave a talk about my experience in several data visualization challenges I participated over the past two years. It was great to summarize what I took from these challenges and while you can find a recording of it, I thought I‚Äôd also summarise it for those who enjoy/prefer reading and witha little more than I could say in those 8 minutes.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll also take this opportunity to thank my wife ‚Äî the night the call for talks closed I came to her and said ‚ÄúNever mind, I‚Äôm not going to submit anything to ISVIS, what can I possibly talk about‚Äù. Luckily she convinced me otherwise, and this talk was born out of it. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

<h2>Data visualization challenges and their educational inspiration</h2>
<p>I‚Äôve actually come across data visualization challenges somewhat by chance. When I started thinking about MA thesis (somewhere in 2019) I realized I wanted to analyze it in something other than SPSS we learned, and was recommended to try out the R programming language.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>But I didn‚Äôt want to wait for my thesis data to arrive, only to be incompetent to analyze it; rather, I wanted to be capable of analyzing it when the time came. In order to do this I had to be able to use R properly, i.e.¬†know how to manipulate and analyze data, which eventually led me to data visualization challenges.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>In the next couple of sections I‚Äôll share what is it I love about and learned from these challenges, with the hope to motivate you to participate in an upcoming one.</p>
<div id="community" class="section level3">
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>As I was roaming across Twitter one day I came across the <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">#TidyTuesday</a> challenge, a data visualization challenge oriented towards the R community. Every week a new dataset is published and the R community is invited to analyze and visualize it.</p>
<p>Observing as a spectator for a few weeks I decided to participate in week 39, 2019. Doing a quick exploratory analysis of the data I noticed a trend, somewhat intuitive, of an increase in the number of visitors to national parks across years. Remembering a plot with added icons from the week before by <a href="https://twitter.com/ariamsita">Ariane Aumaitre</a>, I adapted some of her code and posted my first plot.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>The feedback from the community was amazing. People were glad I joined, wanted to learn how I made the plot, e.g.added the icons, and peak at my code (which took me a few hours to get on GitHub); I was hooked on the project.</p>
<p>As time went by I joined additional community visualization challenges such as the <a href="https://30daymapchallenge.com/">#30DayMapChallenge</a> and <a href="https://30daychartchallenge.org/">#30DayChartChallenge</a>. In different from the #TidyTuesday, in these challenges you bring your own data. The challenges occur throughout a whole month, when each day has a different theme and participants are invited to share maps/charts relating to that theme.</p>
<p>While the two challenges differ, I found a lot in common: <strong>Anyone and everyone are invited, beginners and advanced alike. Plot it in R, Python, Tableau, Qgis and what not. Most importantly, despite never meeting anyone I constantly felt like I was part of a community.</strong></p>

<div id="engaging" class="section level3">
<h3>Engaging</h3>
<p>In challenges that I brought my own data (e.g.¬†30daysX) I realized that when I brought data that engaged me I was more committed to participate. ‚ÄúBut Amit, what‚Äôs <em>engaging data</em>?‚Äù you might ask. Well this broke down for me to two kinds of engagement, meaningful and personal.</p>
<div id="meaningful-data" class="section level4">
<h4>Meaningful <span class="grayit">Data</span></h4>
<p>As someone living in Israel I found data relating to Israel meaningful to explore. I was intrigued and challenged by it, and wanted to answer questions pertaining to it as an Israeli.</p>
<p><img src="Slide10.PNG" alt="Three graphs one next to the other, from left to right: a pictogram of ISraeli prime ministers, Israel's map with elevation and lastly points in a circle representing population per km^2 across Israeli cities."/></p>
<p>So I picked up various datasets relating to Israel and visualized them, for example previous Israeli prime ministers highlighting the only female PM or visualizing Israel‚Äôs elevation. More recently I visualized population density in Israeli cities, a dataset I had laying around and been meaning to explore for a while.</p>
</div>
<div id="personal-data" class="section level4">
<h4>Personal <span class="grayit">Data</span></h4>
<p>Other data that engaged me was something that related to me personally, such as my behavior. Realizing that I collected various data ahead of challenges so by the time the challenge started I was eager to explore them.</p>
<p><img src="02.png" alt="a pictogram of twitter icons, reprsenting how often I use the hashtag #rstats."/></p>
<p>For example as someone who uses Twitter mainly for R related things I was curious to see how much I use the #rstats hashtag, a hashtag commonly associated with the R community. Alternatively, currently living in Tel-Aviv I frequently walk to Dizengoff square, so I was curious to see how long it took to walk to various locations from there.</p>
<p><img src="walking.png" alt="plot of time it takes to walk from dizengof square to different places."/></p>
<p>Meaningful and personal here are somewhat blurry, but I hope it conveys the picture: In challenges you bring your own data (BYOD üòâ) try to find data that engages you, something you‚Äôre passionate about or been wanting to explore for a while. Take these opportunities to explore them, build your portfolio or just answer questions you‚Äôve had laying around for a while.</p>

<div id="learning" class="section level3">
<h3>Learning</h3>
<div id="learning-from-others" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="grayit">Learning</span> from others</h4>
<p>One of the things I love about these challenges is that many of the participants share their code, which you can then adapt for your own needs.</p>
<p>During the #30DayMapChallenge in 2019 <a href="https://alexandrakapp.blog/">Alexandra Kapp</a> published a map of frequently traveled routes in Berlin using simulated data. What she did was, to my interpretation, elegantly brilliant: She sampled two points in Berlin and calculated the shortest route between them. She did this for 500 pairs of points and plotted the routes traveled on where the line width represents the frequency of the street traveled compared to all other streets.</p>
<p>Seeing this and amazed by its simplicity I adapted it for my own needs: The next year I ran the same analysis on Tel-Aviv, producing the plot on the right.</p>
<p><img src="Slide13.PNG" alt="Slides with two similar graphs on theme. On the right is a map of Berlin with routes most frequently travelled on by Alexandra. On the right is my attempt at reproducing it with data regarding Tel-Aviv."/></p>
<p>While this was one example, adapting others‚Äô code is something prevalent in a coder‚Äôs life: You find an answer on Stack Overflow or in some GitHub repository and adapt it to your current need. These challenges provided a great lesson in how to take someone else‚Äôs code and integrate it to what it is you‚Äôre trying to produce.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-new-tools-and-methods" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="grayit">Learning</span> new tools and methods</h4>
<p>Somehow I find this idea - learning new tools and methods - in these challenges somewhat redundant. I mean, unless you‚Äôre proficient in the language you‚Äôreusing, you likely to encounter some challenge you‚Äôll learn from. With that said, pointing them out really helps look at one‚Äôs accomplishments.</p>
<p>For one of the days in the first #30DayMapChallenge I participated I had a vision to create a regular map transitioning to a cartogram. I remember sitting for days trying to work the code, even while following various blog posts. But something constantly went wrong: I had the data in a different format, the post referenced an older version of a package and more. And yet, the feeling after succedding was great, realizing I learned a lot in the process.</p>
<p><img src="20_map.gif" alt="" width = '250'/></p>
<p>I also got to try out different ways of representing data, such as trying to plot data with an extreme outlier, leveraging the area above the plot to highlight it‚Äôs starking distance from other points. At another time I wanted to try out a new tool, so after collecting and aggregating the R packages I use I visualized it using D3.js, something I definetely look forward to exploring more in the future.</p>
<p><img src="01.png" alt="" height = '200'/></p>
<p>What I love about these challenges is even without deliberatly attempting to challenge ourselves it occurs: The data is slightly different than what we‚Äôre used to, we try out one new function and other things that expand our knowledge one step further.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-things-i-implement-at-work" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="grayit">Learning</span> things I implement at work</h4>
<p>As I created charts at work I noticed I would translate a lot of practices I implemented and experimented with in challenges into my work charts. For example, the whole idea of pre-attentive attributes, how do I guide my reader through the chart, showing him where to focus first, second and last. The idea of using color, bold text, miniamlism and much more to guide the reader‚Äôs attention. At other times it was more specific things such as annotations, and using them to guide the audience to the main takeaway at hand.</p>
<p><img src="Slide15.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Sometimes it was even more subtle things, such as having a reprtoire of graphs to choose from or choosing the right one for the data I wanted to present. Either way, I realized that <strong>participating in these challenges made me a better communicator and analyst</strong></p>

<h3>Recapping</h3>
<div id="why-participate" class="section level4">
<h4>Why Participate?</h4>
<p>So if I‚Äôll try to recap my experiences and what I took from these challenges, and why I think you too should join too then it‚Äôs because of the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Welcoming community</strong> ‚Äî The community in the challenges I participated in were very welcoming. Come with any level of experience and tool you use, everyone is welcome, no strings attached as to how frequently you should participate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interacting and being inspired by amazing people</strong> ‚Äî It‚Äôs amazing how many people I learned about and got to interact with from these challenges. My Twitter feed has grown immensely with many of these people I learn from in these challenges and work they continue to share since</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Invitation to leave your comfort zone and challenge yourself</strong> ‚Äî These challenges, in effect, constantly push your limits. A new dataset, a new function or new tool altogether; every theme comes with new and exciting challenges to overcome and learn from.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explore various data</strong> ‚Äî Since you bring your own data to some of these challenges it‚Äôs a great opportunity to explore data you had laying around or something personal. And when the dataset is provided? you get to try out different topics and format of data such as text, time series, networks and more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gain experience and confidence</strong> ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt intentionally join these challenges to become better, but that‚Äôs what happend. When I got my thesis data I was all ready to analyze and confident I‚Äôll be able to overcome any difficulty.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Create something to call your own</strong> ‚Äî The best part of participating in these challenges is suddenly you have this great and diverse portfolio to share with others. Just set up a simple <a href="https://amitlevinson.com/data-visualization/">webpage and host all your contributions</a> to share with othes!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It‚Äôs fun!</strong></p></li>
</ol>
