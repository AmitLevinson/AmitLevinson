A few weeks ago, on May 12, 2022, I gave a talk about my experience in several data visualization challenges I took part in. It was a great experience summarizing what I took from these challenges and while you can find a recording of it, I thought I'd summarise it for those who enjoy reading.

I'll also take this opportunity to thank my wife — the night the call for talks closed I came to her and said "That's it, I'm not going to submit anything to ISVIS, I don't have anything to share". Luckily she convinced me otherwise, and this talk was born out of that process. Thank you.

## Data visualization challenges and their educational inspiration


[Figure about analyzing data in R]

I've actually come across data visualization challenges somewhat by chance. When I started thinking about MA thesis (somewhere in 2019) I realized I wanted to analyze it in something other than SPSS we learned, and was recommended to try out the R programming language. But I didn't want to wait for my thesis data to arrive, only to be incompetent to analyze it; rather, I wanted to be capable and confident in analyzing it when the time came. This is also how I thought about learning R — By manipulating and analyzing data, which eventually led me to data visualization challenges.

In the next couple of sections I'll share it was it I love about and learned from the challenges, and hope to motivate you to participate in an upcoming challenge.

### Community

As I was roaming across Twitter one day I came across the #TidyTuesday challenge, a data visualization challenge oriented towards the R community. every week a new dataset is published and the R community is invited to analyze and visualize it. 

Observing as a spectator for a few weeks I decided to participate in week 39, 2020. Doing a quick exploratory analysis of the data I noticed a trend, somewhat intuitive, ofan increase in the number of visitors to national parks across years. Remembering a plot with added icons from the week before by XXX, I adapted some of her code and posted my first plot.

 The feedback from the community was amazing. People were glad I joined, wanted to learn how I made the plot such as added the icons and peak at my code (which took me a few hours to get onto GitHub). I was hooked on the project.[^1]

[^1]: I've documented more at length the same experience when I [reflected on a year of learning R](https://amitlevinson.com/blog/my-year-in-r/) you might find interesting.

As time went by I joined additional community visualization challenges such as the #30DayMapChallenge and #30DayChartChallenge. In different from the #TidyTuesday, in these challenges you bring your own data. The challenges occur throughout a whole month, every day a different theme and participants are invited to share maps/charts relating to that theme.

While the two challenges differ, I found a lot in common: Anyone and everyone are invited, beginners and advanced alike. Plot it in R, Python, Tableau, Qgis and whatnot. And most importantly despite not knowing almost anyone I felt like I was part of a community in every challenge I joined.

### Engaging

In challenges that I brought my own data (e.g. 30days*) I realized that when I brought data that engaged me I was more committed to participate. So what's engaging? Well this broke down to two kinds of engagement, meaningful and personal.

#### Meaningful <span class='grayit'>Data</span>

As someone living in Israel I found data relating to Israel meaningful to explore. I was intrigued and challenged by it, and wanted to answer questions pertaining to it as an Israeli.

<img src="Slide10.png" alt="Three graphs one next to the other, from left to right: a pictogram of ISraeli prime ministers, Israel's map with elevation and lastly points in a circle representing population per km^2 across Israeli cities."/>


So I picked up various datasets relating to Israel, for example previous Israeli prime ministers and Israel's elevation. More recently I visualized population density in Israeli cities, a dataset I had laying around and wanted to look at for a while.

#### Personal <span class='grayit'>Data</span>

Other data that engaged me was something that related to me personally, such as my behavior. Realizing that I collected various data ahead of some of these challenges so by the time the challenge started I was eager to explroe them.  

For example as someone who uses Twitter mainly for R related things I was curious to see how much I use the #rstats hashtag, a hashtag commonly associated with the R community. Alternatively, currently living in Tel-Aviv I frequently walk to Dizengoff square, so I was curious to see walking distances from the square.

<img src="Slide11.png" alt="Two graphs one next to the other. The left one shows a pictogram of twitter icons, reprsenting how often I use the hashtag #rstats; the right one plots walking distances from dizengof square."/>


Meaningful and personal here are somewhat blurry, but I hope it conveys the picture. In challenges you bring your own data (BYOD `r emo::ji('wink')`) find data that engages you, something you're passionate about or been wanting to explore for a while. Take these opportunities to explore them, build your portfolio or just answer questions you've had laying around for a while.

### Learning

#### <span class='grayit'>Learning</span> from others

One of the things I love about these challenges is that many of the participants share their code, which you can then adapt for your own needs. 

During the #30DayMapChallenge in 2019 Alexandra Kapp published a map of frequently traveled routes in Berlin. What she did was, to my interpretation, elegantly brilliant: She sampled two points in Berlin and calculated the fastest route between them. She did this for 500 pairs of points and plotted the routes traveled on with the line width representing the frequency of the street traveled compared to all other streets.

Seeing this and amazed by its simplicity I adapted it for my own needs: The next year I ran the same analysis on Tel-Aviv, producing the plot on the right.

While this was one example, adapting others' code is something prevalent in a coder's life: You find an answer on Stack Overflow or copy the example in a GitHub repository. Participating in these challenges de-facto motivated me to learn others' code and view different approaches to the same data.


#### <span class='grayit'>Learning</span> new tools and methods

Somehow I find this idea - learning new tools and methods - in these challenges somewhat redundant. However, pointing them out really helps look at one's accomplishments.

I remember sitting for days trying to configure the transition of a map to a cartogram. Even while following a blog post something went wrong: I had the data in a different format, the post referenced an older version of a package, etc. But the feeling after succedding; boi was it great!

I also got to try out different ways of representing data, such as trying to plot data with an extreme outlier, leveraging the area above the plot to highlight it's starking distance from other points.

At another time I wanted to try out a new tool, so after collecting and aggregating the R packages I use I visualized it using D3.js, something I definetely look forward to exploring more.

What I love about these challenges is even without deliberatly attempting to challenge ourselves it occurs: The data is slightly different than what we're used to, we try out one new function and other things that expand our knowledge one step further.


#### <span class='grayit'>Learning</span> things I can implement at work

By the time I started working at Payoneer I participated in various challenges and had the opportunity to participate in a few more since. 

As I created charts at work I noticed I would translate a lot of practices I implemented and experimented with in challenges into my work charts. For example the whole idea of pre-attentive attention, how do I guide my reader through the chart, showing him where to focus first, second and last. The idea of using color, bold text, miniamlism and much more to guide the reader's attention. At other times it was more specific things such as annotations, and using them to guide the audience to the main takeaway at hand.

Sometimes it was even more subtle things, such as having a reprtoire of graphs to choose from or choosing the right one for the data I wanted to present. Either way, I realized that **participating in these challenges made me a better communicator and analyst
