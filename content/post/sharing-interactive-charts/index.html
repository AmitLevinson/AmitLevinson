<p>The TL;DR for those who already have a ready html file:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go into your github repository where the html file is located.<br />
</li>
<li>On the top right click <code>Settings</code> <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> Scroll down to <code>Github Pages</code> section <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> instead of <code>none</code> choose <code>master branch</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Thatâ€™s it! You can now find your html widget under username.github.io/repo-name/file.html.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>A few weeks ago I gave my first talk about <a href="https://amitlevinson.com/talk/israel-2050/">analyzing and visualizing data in R</a>. I shared with participants - political activists - many of Râ€™s abilities, one of them being â€˜interactive visulizationsâ€™ which I very much like. I believe interactive graphs provide some edge a static graph has, of course when used properly. For political activists posting on Facebook they can post a gif showing the interactivity in the Graph and provide users a follow link to explore it themselves. If you have your own website you can host it there. However, when I first started with R I didnâ€™t have a website and today I sometimes just want to share the specific .html without hosting it on my web page.</p>
<div id="why-host-it-online-altogether" class="section level4">
<h4>Why host it online altogether?</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Sending html files with your new interactive graph can be cumbersome, especailly if itâ€™s a work and progress with updated versions you keep sending ðŸ˜­.</p></li>
<li><p>You participated on <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">#Tidytuesday</a> and want to share your graph for others to explore themselves. If so, Here I also recommend recording a gif or video where you interact with it along with a link for exploring, donâ€™t only refer others to the link.</p></li>
<li><p>Because once you set up your GitHub repository, itâ€™s just 2 more lines of code for facilitating an online interactive version.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Actually, one of the answers came to me as I was trying to host my talk slides on my github account. There are many useful tutorials for hosting slides and static files online that you can find <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/deploy-xaringan-slides-to-github-pages/16459">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tcgriffith/xaringan_gh">here</a>, and <a href="https://annaken.github.io/hosting-revealjs-presentation-github-pages/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I found these very useful for hosting my slides and wanted to share that same tutorial aimed at hosting <code>html</code> files. The format is easy as weâ€™ll see, but I remember when starting off with R I didnâ€™t know how. Actually, I was naive and pushed my html file to GitHub thinking once itâ€™s there I can interact with it. Although itâ€™s pretty much that, we need to first turn our GitHub repository into a GitHub page, letâ€™s go ahead and begin.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="saving-an-html-file" class="section level3">
<h3>Saving an html file</h3>
<p>Saving an interactive plot - such as a {leafly} or {highcharter} map, {plotly} - can be done with various packages, I recommend using the <code>{htmlwidgets}</code> package since it nicely fits the browser page, but of course you can try out others and see what suits you (for e.g.Â <code>{htmltools}</code>)</p>
<p>Letâ€™s take a #Tidytuesday dataset I used to create a <code>{highcharter}</code> map of median GDPR fines, where you can find the code for it <a href="XXXX">here</a>.</p>
<p>So we have our map ready and can interact with it within R, as we can see in the gif below:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>knitr::include_graphics(&quot;interactive-in-r.gif&quot;)</code></pre>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-1"></span>
<img src="interactive-in-r.gif" alt="Our interactive graph is all set on R, What's next?" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1: Our interactive graph is all set on R, Whatâ€™s next?
</p>
</div>
<p>Now we want to export it to .html. Make sure to save your graph into an object, letâ€™s say for this example the object is called â€˜hc_gdprâ€™, and now we can export it to an html file with the following code. but before we do that, <code>htmlwidget::saveWidget</code> argument expands the object to fit the whole html page. If youâ€™d like to adjust itâ€™s width and height parameters, you can add them to the html object, which is basically a list:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hc_gdpro$width &lt;- &quot;1400px&quot;
hc_gdpro$width &lt;- &quot;700px&quot;</code></pre>
<p>And now we can save our file where the knitrOptions takes our height and width configuration. Play around with it untill it satisfactory to you, depends for what I need it but I found the default setting (seems like 100% width and height) adequate.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>saveWidget(hc-gdpr, &quot;hc-gdpr.html&quot;, selfcontained = TRUE, knitrOptions = list())</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="github-pages" class="section level3">
<h3>GitHub pages</h3>
<p>Great, we now have a new html file containing our graph saved in our working directory. If you open it up it should run smoothly, only notice itâ€™s doing so on your comuter. Next thing we want to do is host it online so others can interact with it. Weâ€™ll be using GitHub pages approach, so if youâ€™re not familiar with hosting your files to github through R I recommend following <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/">happygitwithr</a> tutorial for getting your account set up.<br />
You can either open a new repository for hosting your .html files, or if itâ€™s a #Tidytuesday like mine sometimes are you can just push it along with your <code>R</code> code file for that week. Make sure to include the html file, hosting only the code (.R / .Rmd) wonâ€™t render it interactive, but you can also host only the html without the code.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>knitr::include_graphics(&quot;hosted.jpg&quot;)</code></pre>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-4"></span>
<img src="hosted.jpg" alt="Once you Rendered your html object, push it to a Github repository" width="698" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Now that we have our file hosted, either on our #Tidytuesday repo or a designated repository for html files, we can assign our Github page.</p>
<p>Choose a repository you want to turn into a Github page (you can do several) and enter it. Click on <code>Settings</code> on the top right and scroll down until you reach the GitHub Pages section. There you want to enable the GitHub pages by changing the deafult None to <code>master-branch</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>knitr::include_graphics(&quot;github-pages.jpg&quot;)</code></pre>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-5"></span>
<img src="github-pages.jpg" alt="After pushing your file, turn your Github repository into a Github page" width="616" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Thatâ€™s it! you can find your hosted html file at <code>username.github.io/repo-name/file.html</code></p>
<p>As I said earlier, Iâ€™m not too familiar with GitHub pages so act with caution. If you donâ€™t want to take chances you can always create a designated repo for hosting files online. I used my TidyTuesday repo because then it helps me aggregate both the code and the html file. If you want to learn more about adding a theme to GitHub pages check out <a href="https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/github-and-rstudio/">this post</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
