<h3>Background</h3>
<p>A few weeks ago I gave my first talk about <a href="https://amitlevinson.com/talk/israel-2050/">analyzing and visualizing data in R</a>. I shared with participants - political activists - many of Râ€™s abilities, one of them creating â€˜interactive visualizationsâ€™ which I very much like. I believe interactive graphs provide some edge to a static graph, of course when used properly. The first time I created an interactive graph for <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">#TidyTuesday</a>, I was left with the question <strong>how to provide others the ability to interact with it?</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="tldr" class="section level3">
<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>For those who already have a ready html file:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go into your GitHub repository where the html file is located.<br />
</li>
<li>On the top right click <code>Settings</code> <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> Scroll down to <code>Github Pages</code> section <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> instead of <code>none</code> choose <code>master branch</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Thatâ€™s it! You can now find your html widget under username.GitHub.io/repo-name/file.html.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-host-it-online" class="section level3">
<h3>Why host it online?</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Sending html files with your new interactive graph can be cumbersome, especially if itâ€™s a work in progress with updated versions you keep sending ðŸ˜¢. Enough with those <code>html_4_final</code> names!</p></li>
<li><p>You participated on <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">#Tidytuesday</a> and want to share your graph for others to explore themselves. In this case I recommend recording a gif or video where you interact with the graph and host it online for others to explore.</p></li>
<li><p>Because once you set up your GitHub page up, itâ€™s just 2 more lines of code saving it as a file and pushing it to your repository.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://imgflip.com/i/3z9x4s"><img src="https://i.imgflip.com/3z9x4s.jpg" title="made at imgflip.com"/></a></p>
<p>There are many useful tutorials for hosting slides and static files online that you can find <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/deploy-xaringan-slides-to-github-pages/16459">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tcgriffith/xaringan_gh">here</a>, and <a href="https://annaken.github.io/hosting-revealjs-presentation-github-pages/">here</a>. I found these very useful for hosting slides from the talk I gave and wanted to share that same tutorial aimed at hosting <code>html</code> graphs, technically the same file (html). The format is identical, but I remember when starting off with R I didnâ€™t know how. I was naive and just pushed my html file to GitHub thinking once itâ€™s there I can interact with it. Although itâ€™s pretty much that, we first need to turn our GitHub repository into a GitHub page.</p>
</div>
<div id="saving-an-html-file" class="section level3">
<h3>Saving an html file</h3>
<p>Saving an interactive plot - such as a {leafly}, {highcharter}, {plotly} or any other interactive object - can be done with various packages. Here Iâ€™ll use the <code>{htmlwidgets}</code> package since it nicely fits the browser page, but of course you can try out others and see what suits you (for e.g.Â <code>{htmltools}</code>)</p>
<p>Letâ€™s take a #Tidytuesday dataset I used to create a <code>{highcharter}</code> map of median GDPR fines, where you can find the code for it <a href="XXXX">here</a>.</p>
<p>So, we have our map ready and can interact with it within R, as we can see in the gif below:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>knitr::include_graphics(&quot;interactive-in-r.gif&quot;)</code></pre>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-1"></span>
<img src="interactive-in-r.gif" alt="Our interactive graph is all set on R, What's next?" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Now we want to save it on our computer. Make sure to save your graph into an object, letâ€™s say for this example our object is called â€˜hc_gdprâ€™. Before we save it using <code>htmlwidget::saveWidget</code>, we can define how the graph will render on an html page. If youâ€™d like to adjust itâ€™s width and height parameters, you can add them to the html object which is saved as a list:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hc_gdpro$width &lt;- &quot;1400px&quot;
hc_gdpro$width &lt;- &quot;700px&quot;</code></pre>
<p>And now we can write our file, when the <code>knitrOptions</code> takes our height and width configuration. Play around with it untill it satisfactory for you. Depends for what I need it but I found the default setting (seems like 100% width and height) adequate.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>saveWidget(hc-gdpr, &quot;hc-gdpr.html&quot;, selfcontained = TRUE, knitrOptions = list())</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="github-pages" class="section level3">
<h3>GitHub pages</h3>
<p>Great, we now have a new html file containing our graph saved in our working directory. If you open it up it should run smoothly, only notice itâ€™s doing so on your local computer. Next thing we want to do is host it online so others can interact with it too.<br />
Weâ€™ll be hosting it on GitHub pages, so if youâ€™re not familiar with hosting your files to GitHub through R I recommend following <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/">happygitwithr</a> tutorial for getting your account set up.<br />
You can open a new repository for hosting your html files, but I think using the one where you host your source code is better. For example if itâ€™s a #Tidytuesday graph like mine, I just push it along with my <code>R</code> source code for that week. Make sure to include the html file, hosting only the code (.R / .Rmd) wonâ€™t render it interactive; You can also host the html without the code.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>knitr::include_graphics(&quot;hosted.jpg&quot;)</code></pre>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-4"></span>
<img src="hosted.jpg" alt="After writing your html object, push it to a Github repository" width="698" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Now that we have our file hosted we can assign our GitHub page: In the repository your html is hosted, click on <code>Settings</code> on the top right and scroll down until you reach the â€˜GitHub Pagesâ€™ section. There you want to enable the GitHub pages by changing the default â€˜Noneâ€™ to <code>master-branch</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>knitr::include_graphics(&quot;GitHub-pages.jpg&quot;)</code></pre>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-5"></span>
<img src="GitHub-pages.jpg" alt="Turn your Github repository into a Github page" width="616" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Thatâ€™s it! you can find your hosted html file at <code>username.github.io/repo-name/file.html</code></p>
<p>Of course once you have a GitHub page you can do so much more with it (personal website for e.g.), but thatâ€™s for a different post altogether. If you want to learn more about adding a theme to GitHub pages check out <a href="https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/github-and-rstudio/">this post</a>.</p>
<p>Another option to host your html file would be on <a href="https://rpubs.com/">Rpubs</a>, but I find the GitHub page option more than adequate for my needs.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
