<h3>Background</h3>
<p>A few weeks ago I gave my first talk about <a href="https://amitlevinson.com/talk/israel-2050/">analyzing and visualizing data in R</a>. I shared with the political activists participants many of R’s abilities, one of them being ‘interactive visulizations’. I believe these kind of graphs can sometimes add the-extra-edge a static graph has. For example, you can record a gif reviewing the graph, post the gif on Facebook and invite users to engage with the graph.</p>
<p><strong>Also as R users</strong> we sometimes want to share our interactive graphs. When I work on a visualization for TidyTuesday I sometimes challenge myself and make something I’ve never done before. If I made an interactive visualizaiton I wasn’t sure what do with it so I’d record a gif and upload that with a link to the source code. <em>But what if I wanted to share my #Tidytuesday interactive graph with non R users?</em></p>
