R is an extraordinary tool that can help us prepare and visualize information. The slides were given to a group of fellows of the program [Israel-2050](https://israel2050.co.il/) which I was a member of at 2017. As political activists we want to provide our readers with information that will stay with them in some way or another. To show how we can do this in R, I first outline how I learned to work with data. The rest of the talk focuses on features I believe are powerful when using R such as wrangling and visualizing data. The slide don't consist of the `rmarkdown::render()` live examlpe I did of knitting with parameters. You can find the source code and a rendered pdf example under the folder 'rmarkdown_eg' in the [slide's repository](https://github.com/AmitLevinson/slides-israel-2050). This is not a hands-on learning session but an exposure to the abilities of R.
