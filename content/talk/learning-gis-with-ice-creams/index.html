<p>Before coming across R I never thought I’d manipulate spatial data. I started my R journey intending to analyze my thesis survey and discovered a plethora of analytic possibilities, one of them being spatial data. After fiddling around and creating some simple maps, I realized I had to dig deeper into R’s spatial capabilities.</p>
<p>In this talk I outline my journey of learning how to work with spatial data from a <a href="https://amitlevinson.com/blog/exploring-ice-cream-locations/">former blog post of mine</a>. I outline my motivations to learning and the project itself: From data collection, data cleaning, and spatial manipulations to presenting the findings. Lastly, I discuss how this all relates to Open Source as an eco-system that enabled me to go on this adventure.</p>
