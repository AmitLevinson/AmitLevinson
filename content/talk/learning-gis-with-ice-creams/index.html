<p>I never thought Iâ€™d be able to manipulate spatial data. I started my R journey intending to analyze my thesis survey and discovered a plethora of analytical possibilities, one of them is spatial data. After fiddeling around and creating some maps here in there in I realized I had to dig in deeper.</p>
<p>In this talk I outline my journey of learning how to work with spatial data from a <a href="https://amitlevinson.com/blog/exploring-ice-cream-locations/">former blog post of mine</a>. I outline my motivations to learning how to work with GIS in R and the project itself: From data collection, cleaning to spatial manipulations and presenting of the findings. Lastly I discuss how this all relates to Open Source as a platform that enabled me to go on this adventure.</p>
