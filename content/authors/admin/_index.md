**Hi!** I'm Amit Levinson; I love to explore, analyze and visualize data. I currently live with my wife, our baby boy and our dog [Milo](https://milo-the-dog.amitlevinson.com/) in Tel-Aviv, Israel. My interests include Privacy & Trust, Data analytics, Visualizations, Statistics and `R`. That's also what you'll probably find me writing about on this website :smile:
