Hi, I'm Amit Levinson, I'm an MA student for [sociology & anthropology](https://in.bgu.ac.il/humsos/soc-ant/en/Pages/default.aspx) at [Ben-Gurion University of the Negev](https://in.bgu.ac.il/en/Pages/default.aspx). I currently live with my wife in Be'er Sheva, southern Israel. My interests include my thesis topic, drug markets and technology, other fields such as political participation, statistics and *`R`*. I'm currently working as a research assistant for [Dr. Jennifer Oser](https://www.jenniferoser.com/) from the [Department of politics and government](https://in.bgu.ac.il/en/humsos/politics/Pages/default.aspx) researching online and offline political participation. You can also find my full CV [here](https://amitlevinson.com/cv/).

I opened this website so that I can share what I learn throughout my journey in R. Make sure to check out posts shared on [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/). Enjoy!
