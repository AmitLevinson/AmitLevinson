**Hi!** I'm Amit Levinson, a self-taught coder and an avid data wrangler. I currently live with my wife in Tel-Aviv, Israel. My interests include Privacy & Trust, Data analytics, Visualizations, Statistics and `R`. That's also what you'll probably find me writing about on this website.

**I'm currently looking for my next role**, one that'll entail analyzing and visualizing data ([see the graph I made for the occasion](https://amitlevinson.com/img/job-search/network.png)). Feel free to reach out if you know of any opportunities!

Make sure to visit [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) & [R-weely](https://rweekly.org/) to explore many more tutorials and resources. Enjoy!
